# to-goal

A to-do list application that ties tasks to specific goals in your life. With to-goal, the idea is simple: 
 - Each task should be tied to a goal
 - Each task must be short enough to get completed today
 - You can only have three tasks a day to curb overwhelm and move your goals forward
 - Any tasks unrelated to goals are kept in a container and handled once you've met the day's focus

 Life is full of chaos. When we focus on what we care about, we find fulfillment.
